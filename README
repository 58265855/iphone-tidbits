Here is a collection of code I've written for the iPhone that I've found useful in more than one project.

It is a fairly random collection. Currently we have:

1. JsonUrlConnection -- makes it a little easier to talk to a Json web service asynchronously. 

2. BinaryDataScanner/BinaryDataWriter -- read and write byte streams, deal with endian-ness, etc. Has been useful for cracking random/old binary file formats.

3. FlickDynamics -- implements the motion dynamics of Cocoa Touch's UIScrollView, but does so in a way that you can slot it in anywhere. I wrote it to handle scroll dynamics of a game's OpenGL|ES view.

All code is released under the BSD license.

If you use it in an app, please let me know! (And feel free to email me with any questions/submit any imrovements.)
